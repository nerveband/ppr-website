# Developer Implementation Plan for Principal Powered Reading Website

This document outlines the current state of the website based on a study of the codebase and provides a comprehensive plan detailing the steps and improvements needed to bring the site to full functionality.

---

## 1. Current Status Overview

- **Scaffolding & Structure:**  
  The core Next.js project structure is in place. Basic directories (such as `src`, `public`, configuration files, etc.) have been set up using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint. The temporary setup has been moved to the root directory.

- **Installed Dependencies:**  
  The project is using modern web technologies including:
  - Next.js with React
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Redux Toolkit for state management
  - Zod and React Hook Form for form validation
  - Shadcn UI and Radix UI for UI components (though integration issues exist)
  - Jest and React Testing Library for testing
  - next-i18next for internationalization

- **Noticed Issues:**  
  - **Shadcn UI Integration:** The command `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` resulted in a “command not found” error. This indicates that the CLI tool hasn’t been installed or isn’t correctly added to the PATH.
  - **Incomplete Functionality:** Although the basic structure is established, key features such as form submissions (contact, workshop registration), API routes, e-commerce integration, and internationalization are still pending implementation.
  - **Deployment & Optimization:** There is no clear deployment process in place yet, and additional work is required for SEO optimization, accessibility improvements, and performance enhancements.

---

## 2. Issues and Areas Needing Fixing

1. **Shadcn UI Integration:**  
   - The tool is not initializing as expected. This might be due to installation issues or misconfigured scripts.
   
2. **Missing API Routes and Contact/Form Functionality:**  
   - Contact forms and workshop registration forms require proper API endpoints, along with proper schema validation using Zod.
   
3. **E-commerce Integration:**  
   - The integration for accepting payments (using Stripe or a similar API) needs to be built, including creating checkout flows and handling success/error scenarios.
   
4. **Internationalization (i18n):**  
   - The next-i18next configuration must be created and integrated so that the website supports multiple languages.
   
5. **SEO, Accessibility & Performance Enhancements:**  
   - Meta tags, structured data, and proper usage of Next.js Head components need to be implemented.
   - Accessibility checks (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation) should be enforced.
   - Performance optimizations (code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization) are pending.
   
6. **Testing & Documentation:**  
   - Unit and integration tests for key components and pages need to be authored.
   - Update documentation (README and Memory Bank files) to reflect the new tech stack and implementation details.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Resolve Shadcn UI Integration Issues
- **Action Items:**
  - Confirm the correct installation of the `@shadcn/ui` package.
  - If the CLI tool is missing, install it as a dev dependency or try using `npx` with the correct options.
  - Verify that the package is included in the project’s PATH; consider adding a script in `package.json` such as:
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "init:ui": "npx shadcn-ui@latest init"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Rerun the CLI initialization and check for errors.

### Task 2: Build Core Pages and Components
- **Page Structure:**  
  Create the following pages inside the `src/app` directory:
  - **Homepage:** Display the hero section, overview of services, workshop call-to-action, and navigation.
  - **Workshops Page:** List available workshops with registration links.
  - **Founder & Instructor Page:** Highlight the founder’s bio with credentials.
  - **What Makes Us Different:** Explain the unique value proposition.
  - **Free Class Page:** Similar to workshops but tailored for free sample classes.
  - **Contact Page:** Include a contact form for inquiries.
  
- **Common Components:**  
  - Navigation (both header and footer)
  - Layout wrapper to enforce consistent styling
  - Reusable UI elements (buttons, form inputs, cards, etc.) from Shadcn UI/Radix UI

- **SEO & Accessibility:**  
  - Utilize the `<Head>` component in each page to include meta tags (title, description, viewport, etc.).
  - Ensure that semantic HTML (using `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.) is used and that ARIA attributes are applied where necessary.

### Task 3: Set Up API Routes and Form Validation
- **API Routes (e.g., in `src/app/api`):**
  - Create a route for handling contact form submissions (e.g., `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`):
    - Validate incoming data using the provided Zod schemas.
    - Implement proper error handling and success response.
  - Similarly, set up API routes for workshop registration if needed.
  
- **Form Validation:**
  - Integrate React Hook Form in your contact and registration components.
  - Use the provided Zod schemas (like `contactFormSchema`, `workshopRegistrationSchema`, etc.) to enforce validation.
  - Provide error handling and messaging in UI components.

### Task 4: Integrate E-commerce Functionality
- **Stripe (or alternative):**
  - Add and configure the Stripe API for payment processing.
  - Create checkout flows for the “Reading Motivation Workshop”:
    - Set up the necessary client-side integration.
    - Establish secure API routes (if necessary) for handling payment intents and processing responses.
  - Ensure proper handling of payment success and error cases.

### Task 5: Configure Internationalization (next-i18next)
- **Action Items:**
  - Create and configure a `next-i18next.config.js` file.
  - Update `next.config.js` to include i18n settings.
  - Create language resource files (e.g., in a `public/locales` directory).
  - Test language switching within the site.

### Task 6: Optimize for SEO, Accessibility, and Performance
- **SEO:**
  - Use Next.js `<Head>` component to embed meta tags, structured data, canonical URLs, etc.
  - Set up a sitemap and robots.txt file.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Audit the site with tools such as Lighthouse.
  - Ensure proper usage of semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and keyboard interactivity.
- **Performance:**
  - Implement code-splitting (e.g., using dynamic imports where appropriate).
  - Optimize images (e.g., using Next.js Image component).
  - Audit and optimize bundle sizes and loading states.

### Task 7: Testing and Documentation
- **Testing:**
  - Configure Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Write unit tests for components and integration tests for main workflows.
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests.
  
- **Documentation:**
  - Update the README.md with development setup instructions.
  - Ensure Memory Bank documents (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, etc.) are updated.
  - Use JSDoc comments throughout the code for clarity.

### Task 8: Deployment and CI/CD Setup
- **Deployment Provider:**  
  - Choose a provider such as Vercel or Netlify.
  - Set up environment variables (e.g., Stripe keys, site URL, etc.) in the deployment configuration.
  
- **CI/CD Process:**
  - Implement automated testing in your CI pipeline.
  - Configure deployment scripts (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run lint, tests, and build steps before deployment.
  
- **Monitoring & Analytics:**
  - Integrate basic analytics (Google Analytics, Lighthouse CI) for performance monitoring.
  - Set up error reporting (using Sentry or similar) to track runtime exceptions.
