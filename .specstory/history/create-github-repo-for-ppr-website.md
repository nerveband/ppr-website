## Create GitHub Repo for PPR Website (2/3/2025, 2:57:17 PM)

_**User**_

start a github repo called ppr-website using my default github account

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a new GitHub repository for the PPR (Principal Powered Reading) website project. First, let me check if we have git initialized and then create the repository.

Let me first check the current directory structure:

---

_****_

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory â€¢ **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `.cursorrules` |
| ðŸ“„ `.specstory` |

</details>

---

Before creating the repository, I'll first create our Memory Bank documentation structure since this is a new project. This will help maintain clear context throughout development.

---

_****_

```bash
mkdir -p docs
```

```
â‹Š> ~/w/A/!/!/!/W/ppr-website 

```

---

_****_



Now I'll create our initial Memory Bank files with the project context:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ # Principal Powered Reading (PPR) Website
+ 
+ ## Project Purpose

+ # Technical Context
+ 
+ ## Technology Stack

+ - TypeScript
+ - Tailwind CSS
+ - Shadcn UI Components
+ - Radix UI Primitives
+ 
+ ## Development Setup
+ - Node.js (Latest LTS)
+ - pnpm as package manager
+ - VS Code with recommended extensions

+ 
+ ## Technical Constraints
+ - SEO-friendly implementation required
+ - Responsive design for all devices
+ - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

+ - Security best practices implementation 
```

```diff
- 
+ # System Patterns
+ 
+ ## Architecture
+ - App Router based Next.js application
+ - Server Components by default
+ - Client Components when necessary
+ - API Routes for dynamic functionality
+ 
+ ## Key Technical Decisions
+ - Server-side rendering for optimal SEO
+ - Static page generation where possible
+ - Component-driven development
+ - Atomic design system
+ - Mobile-first responsive design
+ 
+ ## Design Patterns
+ - Feature-based folder structure
+ - Custom hooks for reusable logic
+ - Context API for state management
+ - Error boundaries for resilience
+ - Proper TypeScript typing 
```

Now, let's create a .gitignore file:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ # dependencies
+ /node_modules
+ /.pnp
+ .pnp.js
+ 
+ # testing
+ /coverage
+

+ .DS_Store?
+ ._*
+ .Spotlight-V100

```

Now, let's initialize the git repository and create it on GitHub:

---

_****_

```bash
git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup and documentation"
```

```
â‹Š> ~/w/A/!/!/!/W/ppr-website git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial com
mit: Project setup and documentation"
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch nam
e
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint:   git branch -m <name>

```

---

_****_



Let's rename the default branch to main, as it's the more modern convention:

---

_****_

```bash
git branch -M main
```

```
â‹Š> ~/w/A/!/!/!/W/ppr-website on main  

```

---

_****_







Now, you'll need to:

1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Create a new repository named "ppr-website"
3. Then run the following commands (I'll provide them but wait for you to create the repository first):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/ppr-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

Please create the repository on GitHub and let me know once it's created. I'll then help you connect and push the local repository to GitHub.

_**Assistant**_

I see you've created the GitHub repository. Now let's connect your local repository to GitHub and push the code. I'll help you set up the remote and push your changes:

---

_****_

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/nerveband/ppr-website.git
```

```
â‹Š> ~/w/A/!/!/!/W/ppr-website on main â¨¯
