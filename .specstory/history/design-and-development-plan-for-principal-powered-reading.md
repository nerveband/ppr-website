The overall design should reflect the company's mission of empowering educational leaders with research-based practices to transform school-wide reading instruction and student outcomes.
I'll convert the provided website content into a clear markdown format based on the documents:

# Principal Powered Reading

## Our Mission
When a school leader has a research-informed vision of school-wide reading instruction and practice, teachers flourish as literacy educators and students grow into successful readers. This is what we mean by Principal Powered Reading.

### Who We Serve
Principals and other school leaders, teacher-leaders, and educational leaders.

### What We Do
We empower Principals and other educational leaders with key literacy research and research-informed practices to transform their schools.

### Why It Matters
School leaders need a deep understanding of the research related to how children and young adults develop into successful readers so they can evaluate and improve school-wide reading programs and practices.

### How We Work
We offer live workshops (on zoom or in-person), each of which addresses one core literacy-based topic. You learn the key findings of the scientific research and how to apply research-backed principles and strategies to build upon or transform your current school-wide literacy practices related to that topic.

## What Makes Us Different
Most literacy-based trainings rightly focus on teaching teachers. While training for teachers demands a focus on day-to-day lessons and instructional techniques, training for Principals and other school leaders requires a broader focus on how the findings from reading research translate into key school-wide decisions related to curriculum, staffing, professional development, family engagement, and more.

## The Science of Reading Perspective
The growing "science of reading" movement aims to bring research-based reading practices into classrooms. However, this catchphrase often narrowly refers to only one aspect ("phonics") of a much broader set of key research findings. It is this broader research, established over decades in the fields of cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience, that is our focus.

## Our Workshops
- Live workshops available online via Zoom or in-person
- Each workshop focuses on one core literacy-based topic
- Build your knowledge at your own pace
- Registration and payment options available
- Professional development credits available

### Reading Motivation Workshop

    - Implement proper state initialization

    Global State
    - Use Redux Toolkit for global state
    - Use createSlice to define state, reducers, and actions together.
    - Avoid using createReducer and createAction unless necessary.
    - Normalize state structure to avoid deeply nested data.
    - Use selectors to encapsulate state access.
    - Avoid large, all-encompassing slices; separate concerns by feature.


    Error Handling and Validation
    Form Validation
    - Use Zod for schema validation
    - Implement proper error messages
    - Use proper form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

    Error Boundaries

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Single-Page Application (SPA) built with Next.js and React.
- **Routing:** Next.js App Router.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Leverage Next.js capabilities for SSR/SSG where appropriate for performance and SEO.
- **Component-Driven:**  Built using reusable React components.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for global state, React Context and useState/useReducer for local component state.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, CSS variables for theming.
- **E-commerce:** Integrate a suitable e-commerce solution (e.g., Stripe API for payments, consider a lightweight e-commerce platform or service if needed for product/order management - to be determined based on specific requirements beyond MVP).

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Framework Choice:** Next.js for its comprehensive features, performance optimizations, and developer experience.
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid and consistent styling.
- **Component Library:** Shadcn UI and Radix UI for accessible and customizable UI components.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for predictable global state management.

## Architecture Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture:**  Modular and reusable UI components.
- **Frontend-Focused:**  Client-side rendering with server-side rendering/static generation for initial load and SEO.
- **API-Driven (Potentially):**  If e-commerce or future features require backend logic, the frontend will interact with APIs. For MVP, e-commerce integration might be primarily frontend-focused using a service like Stripe.
